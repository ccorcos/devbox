# üõ°Ô∏è devbox - Development Environments Made Simple

**Protect your computer from malicious code by isolating your development environments in Docker containers.**

## Why devbox?

Modern development involves installing countless packages from npm, pip, cargo, and other package managers. Each package could potentially contain malicious code exposing yourself to supply chain attacks.

The solution is to sandbox your development environment using Docker containers. But juggling Docker can be combersome so `devbox` was created to make it easy!

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Install Docker and OrbStack (a fast Docker runtime for macOS):

```bash
brew install docker orbstack
```

### Install devbox

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/devbox.git
cd devbox

# Make devbox available system-wide by symlinking it to your PATH
sudo ln -s "$(pwd)/devbox" /usr/local/bin/devbox
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Basic Usage (Default Environment)

Navigate to any project and run devbox:

```bash
cd your-project
devbox
```

This creates a secure container with common development tools and drops you into a shell inside it. Your project files are mounted read-write, but everything else is isolated.

### 2. Custom Project Environment

For project-specific tool requirements:

```bash
cd your-project
devbox init
```

This creates a `Dockerfile.devbox` in your project that you can customize.

Then run:

```bash
devbox
```

Your customized environment will be built and started automatically.

## How It Works

1. **Project Detection**: devbox automatically detects if you have a custom `Dockerfile.devbox` in your project
2. **Image Building**: Creates a Docker image with your specified tools and dependencies
3. **Container Creation**: Spins up an isolated container from the image
4. **File Mounting**: Mounts your project directory into the container so you can edit files
5. **Shell Access**: Drops you into a shell inside the secure container

## Security Benefits

- **Supply Chain Protection**: npm/pip/cargo packages can only access the container, not your host system
- **Clean Environments**: Each project gets a fresh, clean environment without conflicts
- **Consistent Environments**: Same tools and versions across different machines
- **Easy Cleanup**: Delete containers instantly without leaving traces on your system

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `devbox` | Create and attach to your development container |
| `devbox status` | Show status of your containers and images |
| `devbox init` | Create a custom `Dockerfile.devbox` for your project |
| `devbox start` | Start a stopped container |
| `devbox stop` | Stop and remove the current project's container |
| `devbox off` | Stop all devbox containers and shut down Docker |
| `devbox build` | Force rebuild the Docker image |

## Example Workflows

### Web Development with Node.js

```bash
cd my-web-app
devbox init
# Edit Dockerfile.devbox to include Node.js, npm, etc.
devbox
# Inside container:
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Advanced Configuration

### Port Forwarding

By default, port 3000 is forwarded. To use a different port:

```bash
PORT=8080 devbox
```

### Persistent Data

Your project files are automatically mounted and persist between container runs. Everything else in the container is ephemeral.

## Troubleshooting

### Docker/OrbStack Issues

```bash
# Check if Docker is running
devbox status

# Restart OrbStack if needed
orb restart

# running containers
docker ps
# all containers
docker ps -a
# stop all containers
docker stop $(docker ps -q)
# delete all stopped containers
docker container prune -f

# list all images
docker image ls
# delete all images
docker rmi $(docker images -a -q)

# List dangling images that were overwritten
docker images -f dangling=true
# Delete dangling images
docker image prune
```
