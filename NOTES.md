## Docker Notes

```sh
# running containers
docker ps
# all containers
docker ps -a
# stop all containers
docker stop $(docker ps -q)
# delete all stopped containers
docker container prune -f

# list all images
docker image ls
# delete all images
docker rmi $(docker images -a -q)
```

## Devbox Notes



Testing
```sh
devbox build
```


‚ùØ devbox help
Usage: /usr/local/bin/devbox

Commands:
  (no args)  - Create the devbox and attach to it.
  status     - Show status of devbox Dockerfile, image, and container.
  init       - Copy Dockerfile.devbox template to current directory for a project-specific devbox.
  build      - Build/rebuild the devbox Docker image
  delete     - Stops the container, deletes it, and deletes the image.
  start      - Start the container.
  stop       - Stop the container and delete the container.



Lets do an audit of this script and come up with a refactoring plan. Lets try to reduce the amount of redundancy, and lets make use of functions and variables to help provide more readability and clarity.





Currently container names are called $project but I'd like the container names should be `$project-devbox` so we can easily tell which containers and images are devboxes. Same goes with custom images -- those should also be called $project-devbox instead of just $project.


zsh inside look better.
Auto-stop?



Claudemd better
claude inside the devbox.




Handle ctrl-c to stop orb, etc.

## Installation

1. git clone this repo
2. run devbox install which will symlink the devbox command to your local/bin folder.

## Setup

I want future developers to be able to use the Dockerfile for development even if they don't have this tool installed.
So when I go to a new project and run `devbox init` it should create an initial Dockerfile for that project.
That Dockerfile should be loaded up with goodies and make it easy to comment out / uncomment things that I need. For example, node.js tools, python tools, zsh, other utilities. One question here is whether there's a better way of doing this -- is it better to have some other kind of requirements.txt file? Probably not?

## Using it

When I run the devbox command inside a project folder, it tries to get be into a devbox container.
- if there's no Dockerfile, it tells me to run devbox init.
- if orb is not installed, it tells me how to install it.
- if orb is not running, it will start it.
- if the docker image is not built, it will build it.
- then it will run the docker image, drop me into an interactive shell.
- if I run the command in another terminal, I'm in another shell on the same container
- on exit, if there are no more shells open on that container, the container is stopped and deleted

The important thing is that this should make developing a project very similar to using your computer normally. The proj directory is mounted wholesale. I can run `devbox` and then start doing things like `npm install` and `npm run dev` with the ports exposed.

## Cleaning up

The `devbox cleanup` command will delete any images that havent been used in 30 days.
