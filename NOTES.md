## Docker Notes

```sh
# running containers
docker ps
# all containers
docker ps -a
# stop all containers
docker stop $(docker ps -q)
# delete all stopped containers
docker container prune -f

# list all images
docker image ls
# delete all images
docker rmi $(docker images -a -q)
```

## Devbox Notes

Improve the readability of the output for devbox status to look more like this. Give the [LABEL] text an appropriate color too.
> cd geocalc
> devbox status
geocalc
  Dockerfile: /Users/chet/Code/devbox/Dockerfile.devbox
  Image:       devbox [REBUILD NEEDED]
  Container:   geocalc [NOT CREATED]



Testing
```sh
devbox build
```


PORT thing...


default shell:   docker exec -it -w "/$PROJECT_NAME" "$CONTAINER_NAME" sh -c 'exec $0'


Better help.

‚ùØ devbox help
Usage: /usr/local/bin/devbox

Commands:
  (no args)  - Create the devbox and attach to it.
  status     - Show status of devbox Dockerfile, image, and container.
  init       - Copy Dockerfile.devbox template to current directory for a project-specific devbox.
  build      - Build/rebuild the devbox Docker image
  delete     - Stops the container, deletes it, and deletes the image.
  start      - Start the container.
  stop       - Stop the container and delete the container.


Auto-stop?

I think instead, container names should be `$proj-devbox` so each

Handle ctrl-c to stop orb, etc.

## Installation

1. git clone this repo
2. run devbox install which will symlink the devbox command to your local/bin folder.

## Setup

I want future developers to be able to use the Dockerfile for development even if they don't have this tool installed.
So when I go to a new project and run `devbox init` it should create an initial Dockerfile for that project.
That Dockerfile should be loaded up with goodies and make it easy to comment out / uncomment things that I need. For example, node.js tools, python tools, zsh, other utilities. One question here is whether there's a better way of doing this -- is it better to have some other kind of requirements.txt file? Probably not?

## Using it

When I run the devbox command inside a project folder, it tries to get be into a devbox container.
- if there's no Dockerfile, it tells me to run devbox init.
- if orb is not installed, it tells me how to install it.
- if orb is not running, it will start it.
- if the docker image is not built, it will build it.
- then it will run the docker image, drop me into an interactive shell.
- if I run the command in another terminal, I'm in another shell on the same container
- on exit, if there are no more shells open on that container, the container is stopped and deleted

The important thing is that this should make developing a project very similar to using your computer normally. The proj directory is mounted wholesale. I can run `devbox` and then start doing things like `npm install` and `npm run dev` with the ports exposed.

## Cleaning up

The `devbox cleanup` command will delete any images that havent been used in 30 days.
